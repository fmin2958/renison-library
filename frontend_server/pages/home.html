            <p>The East Asian Special Collection (EASC) project was begun in 2013 with the aim of making possible easy access to Chinese, Japanese, and Korean language books and other media to students, faculty, staff, and the general public. The EASC project encompasses the digitization, automation, and organization of existing Asian-language holdings, as well as the acquisition of new materials and media.</p>
            <p>The collection currently contains over 1000 items which you can view on our <a href="http://45.55.82.111:9000/">EASC online catalogue</a>.</p>
